## Additional Information

# Tech Stack

Frontend: React Native - We chose React Native for its robust cross-platform development capabilities, allowing us to build a consistent and native-feeling experience for both Android and iOS users. It also facilitates faster development through code reusability and enables smooth updates across platforms.

Backend: PHP - We opted for PHP due to its widespread adoption, scalability, and large community of developers. Additionally, its compatibility with popular web servers like Apache and Nginx makes deployment and maintenance straightforward.

## Testing

Unit Testing: For isolated testing of individual components and functions, we utilize Jest, a popular framework for React Native. This ensures basic functionality of individual pieces before integration into the whole application.

Integration Testing: We leverage tools like React Native Testing Library to test how frontend components interact with each other and the backend API. This catches issues early in the development process and promotes stable communication between layers.

End-to-End Testing: To simulate real user interactions and verify overall functionality, we employ Appium or Detox. These frameworks automate user journeys, ensuring the app behaves as intended from login to completing transactions.

## Deployment

# Frontend Deployment

Development: For local development and testing, use Expo Go or simulators provided by your IDE.

Production: Depending on your target platform, choose:

Android: Build the app using react-native build android and upload the APK file to Google Play Store.
iOS: Build the app using react-native build ios and upload the IPA file to Apple App Store.

# Backend Deployment

Choose a suitable web hosting provider that supports PHP, like cPanel or DigitalOcean.
Upload the backend codebase to your server.
Configure the database connection and server environment variables.
Set up a web server like Apache or Nginx to serve the API calls.
Further Points:

Security: We prioritize user security by implementing secure authentication protocols, encrypting sensitive data, and adhering to industry best practices for vulnerabilities.

Documentation: Complete API documentation will be available for developers to integrate SperiPay's functionalities into their applications.

Scalability: The chosen technologies offer flexibility and scalability to accommodate future growth in user base and features.

Remember, this is just a framework. Feel free to adjust and expand the details based on your specific project requirements and chosen libraries/frameworks.
